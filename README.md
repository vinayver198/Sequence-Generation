# Sequence-Generation

In  this project I have mainly focussed on sequence generation problems using text  generation. The framing of these problems are inspired by Jason Brownlee book LSTM with Python.

## Predicting polygon co-ordinates using LSTM
In this problem we will be generating the next possible co-ordinates, which will be forming a polygon and plot them using matplotlib.

## Text generation on char-level modelling LSTM

## Text generation on word-level modelling using LSTM
